# Jekyll Codex

A website for front-end developers who want to learn Jekyll. https://jekyllcodex.org

Jekyll Codex is created by Joost van der Schee ([@jhvanderschee](https://twitter.com/jhvanderschee) or joost@vdschee.nl) to make it easier for fellow front-end developers to choose static web technology in their next project. The getting started guide even shows how to do that without touching the command-line. You can also watch [JekyllCodex at JekyllConf 2019](https://vimeo.com/361839295) which shows exactly that in under twenty minutes. Note that this video uses the [jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap version](https://fresh-butterfly.cloudvent.net) of this website. If you want to know more about Jekyll, please visit the official Jekyll documentation. The link can be found in the menu at the top.

Why Jekyll? Jekyll is the most popular static site generator. Static sites are better for performance, they’re cheaper to build and maintain, and they’re much more secure than traditional database driven websites. Thus they offer a great added value to front-end developers and their clients.
